Solving TSP using Genetic Algorithm
  Genetic Algorithm consists of the following parts :
  Population Initialization
  Selection of top K fittest chromosomes from the population where fitness is calculated by usig fitness function
  Mating New population is created by using the top K fittest chromosomes computed in step 2
  Mutation Every chromosome of this newly created population from Mating is mutated
  Mutated population is passed back to step 2 untill certain predefined number of generations are finished.
